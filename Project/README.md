Source Language : subset of Java
Target Language : javascript

Implemented : 
1. Typechecking (Void, bool, int, array of basic types, class objects)
2. Check for at least one return statement in non void returning functions and check their type
3. Check number/types of arguments passed to a function
4. Functions can be recursive
5. - Cannot call a function declared after the calling point
6. Cannot use undefined variables/functions
7. Printing of expression or strings are allowed
8. Check that the program has a main function, and exactly 1 main function
9. Take 2 commanline inputs, 1st for source (java file) 2nd for target (js file)
10. If no target is specified, output is generated in "a.js"
11. original code (with errors in red if any) is printed on terminal and in the end it is mentioned if compilation was aborted or complete
12. - Functions and Classes are required to declare their variables in the beginning
13. If - Then - Else
14. While loop
15. Check if the conditions in If/While are of type bool
16. Program is a list of classes
17. All variables in a class are private, and all functions public
